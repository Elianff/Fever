    "But the dreams came back."
    "Well...you wouldn't call them dreams."
    "It was the same heat waves that blurred your vision."
    "You knew you were dreaming."
    "Was this one of those lucid dreams?"
    "It couldn't be...whenever the kids in school described lucid dreams, they made it sound so cool."
    "They say they could fly or have powers."
    "But... this was just weird."
    "You tried to touch the blur around you, tried to will your body to move."
    "Was it working?"
    "Your hand couldn't reach the blur even though it felt like it was all around you."
    "You forced your feet forward."
    "Move."
    "With great struggle you were walking."
    "You tried to move closer to the spots in the sky..?"
    "Can you call it that?"
    "A sky?"
    "It was more like EVERYTHING. It was EVERYTHING."
    "And yet you couldn't reach it."
    "Every step you took, the harder it was to take the next."
    "It was as if you were trudging through mud."
    "This was a dumb dream."
    "You tried to touch the ground..."
    "Again that wasn't the right word."
    "You couldn't touch it. How was that possible?"
    "You couldn't touch anything in this dream."
    "But it sure was hot in here."
